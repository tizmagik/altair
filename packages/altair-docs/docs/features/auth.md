# Authorization

You can add different authorizations to your request. This grants the client the permissions to access your GraphQL API. Altair applies your chosen authorization before sending your request. Altair supports various authorization methods.

## API Keys

You can specify the API key and value used by your API.

## Basic authorization

Add your username and password credentials if your API supports the [basic authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617) scheme.

## Bearer token

[Bearer token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) is another authentication scheme supported by Altair. This is a common type of authorization used as part of the popular OAuth 2.0 protocol.

## OAuth 2.0

Altair supports the [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) authorization framework. You can specify the client ID, client secret, and other parameters required by your OAuth 2.0 provider.
