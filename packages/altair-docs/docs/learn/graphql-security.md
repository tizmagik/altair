# GraphQL Security Best Practices

[GraphQL](/docs/learn/graphql) has rapidly become the API technology of choice for many modern applications thanks to its efficiency and flexibility. However, these advantages come with unique security challenges that require careful attention. In this article, we’ll explore common GraphQL vulnerabilities and essential security best practices to safeguard your GraphQL APIs and protect your data.

## Understanding the GraphQL security landscape

GraphQL’s flexible query language enables clients to request exactly the data they need, but that same flexibility can be exploited by attackers. Some common issues include:

- **Injection attacks:** Even though GraphQL enforces a strong type system, unsanitized inputs can still lead to SQL, NoSQL, or OS command injection vulnerabilities if resolvers pass user data directly into queries without proper validation.

- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Unbounded query depth, overly complex queries, or batched operations may overload server resources, resulting in service degradation or outages.

- **Excessive data exposure:** GraphQL’s introspection and flexible schema can inadvertently expose internal API structure, making it easier for an attacker to craft malicious queries.

- **Broken access control:** If authorization is performed in multiple places (or not consistently enforced), attackers may bypass access restrictions using alternative query paths.

## Best practices for securing GraphQL APIs

A comprehensive security posture for GraphQL APIs involves multiple layers. Below are key best practices along with practical recommendations and code examples.

### Input validation and sanitization

Validating every input ensures that only expected and safe data is processed. This helps prevent injection attacks and other malicious activities.

- **Define strict input types:** Use GraphQL’s scalar types, enums, and custom scalars with built-in validations to enforce data formats.
- **Sanitize inputs:** Employ libraries or custom middleware to strip out potentially harmful content (such as script tags or special characters) from user-supplied data.

### Query complexity and depth limiting

Limiting query depth and complexity prevents attackers from crafting deeply nested or expensive queries that could overwhelm your backend and lead to DoS vulnerabilities.

- **Depth limiting:** Use middleware such as [`graphql-depth-limit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-depth-limit) to restrict the maximum depth of queries.
- **Complexity analysis:** Assign a “cost” to fields and operations (using libraries like [`graphql-query-complexity`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-query-complexity)) to reject queries that exceed a safe threshold.
- **Pagination:** Implement pagination for list fields to control the amount of data returned in a single request.

### Authentication and authorization

Verifying user identity and ensuring users only access data they’re permitted to is crucial. Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL often uses a single endpoint, making granular authorization even more important.

- **Implement JWTs or OAuth:** Use standard authentication protocols (e.g., JWTs) to secure access. In Altair, you can add your JWT token or get it using authorization flows like OAuth in the [authorization](/docs/features/auth) section.
- **Field-Level authorization:** Use middleware such as [`graphql-shield`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-shield) or custom GraphQL directives (e.g. create a `@requiresAuth` directive)to declaratively enforce authorization rules on individual fields or mutations.
- **Centralize authorization logic:** Where possible, perform authorization checks in a central business logic layer to avoid inconsistencies.

### Disable introspection in production

Introspection is useful in development and enables a lot of features and tooling including [Altair GraphQL Client](https://altairgraphql.dev/), but it can reveal your API’s schema to attackers. Disabling introspection in production helps obscure the inner workings of your API. Only enable introspection in environments that are protected from unauthorized access.

### Secure error handling and logging

Detailed error messages can inadvertently expose sensitive information about your API structure or underlying infrastructure. Limiting this information protects against reconnaissance by attackers.

Use robust logging and monitoring tools to capture error details without exposing them to end users. Also implement mechanisms to limit repeated error responses which might indicate an attack in progress.

## Final thoughts

Embrace these practices, integrate security tools into your CI/CD pipeline, and keep abreast of evolving threats. With a proactive security mindset, your GraphQL APIs can support innovative applications without compromising on security. As always, you can test your GraphQL APIs for vulnerabilities using [Altair GraphQL Client](https://altairgraphql.dev/).
