# Headers and Response Stats

Altair provides flexibility by allowing you to set custom request headers. Also, the
response status code and time taken are available upon completion of the request.

You can also set global headers via the [global environment](./environment-variables). Just add a `headers` payload with your global headers there and these headers would be applied to all the windows.
